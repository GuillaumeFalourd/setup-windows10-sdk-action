### Action input

Field | Mandatory | Observation
------------ | ------------  | -------------
**sdk-version** | YES | The **5-digit** version (build) of the SDK (`10.0.xxxxx.0`) to install <br/> _Examples: `16299`, `17763`, `18362`, `19041`, `20348`, `22000`, `22621`, `26100` (Default is `18362`)._

_Obs: Want to add another sdk-version? [Contribute here!](https://github.com/GuillaumeFalourd/setup-windows10-sdk-action/blob/main/externals/install-winsdk.ps1)_

### Example

#### Default SDK version (18362)

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: GuillaumeFalourd/setup-windows10-sdk-action@v2
```

#### Specific SDK version (20348)

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: GuillaumeFalourd/setup-windows10-sdk-action@v2
  with:
    sdk-version: 20348
```

You would then need to use `CMake` command to use the specific SDK on your workflow.

``` yaml
- name: Build new SDK
  shell: bash
  run: |
    cmake -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=10.0.20348.0
    cmake --build .
```
